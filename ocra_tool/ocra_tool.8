.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to initialize and view OCRA credential files used by the
.Xr pam_ocra 8 authentication service module for PAM.
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm info"
.It Cm info
Show content of OCRA credential file.
.Bl -tag -width ".FL f"
.It Fl f Ar credential_file
the OCRA credential file.
.El
.It Cm init
Initialize OCRA credential file.
.Bl -tag -width ".FL f"
.It Fl f Ar credential_file
the OCRA credential file.
.It Fl s Ar suite_string
OCRA suite string.
.It Fl k Ar key
specified as hexadecimal string.
.It Fl c Ar counter
If the
.Ar suite_string
requires a counter parameter,
.Ar counter
is the initial counter value. If
.Ar counter
begins with '0x' it will be interpreted as hexadecimal number.
.It Fl p Ar pin | Fl P Ar pin_hash
If the
.Ar suite_string
requires a pin-hash parameter, it is either set as hexadecimal string
.Ar pin_hash
or calculated from
.Ar pin
using the pin-hash algorithm in
.Ar suite_string .
.It Fl q Ar kill_pin | Fl Q Ar kill_pin_hash
If the
.Ar suite_string
requires a pin-hash parameter, it is optional to provide a kill pin. If this
pin is used, the the authentication fails, all future authentications also fail.
The kill pin is set as hexadecimal string
.Ar kill_pin_hash
or calculated from
.Ar kill_pin
using the pin-hash algorithm in
.Ar suite_string .
.It Fl w Ar counter_window
If the
.Ar suite_string
requires a counter parameter,
.Ar counter_window
specifies the maximum number of verify attempts
.Xr pam_ocra 8
will make (while incrementing the counter value).
This parameter is optional.
.It Fl t Ar timestamp_offset
If the
.Ar suite_string
requires a timestamp parameter,
.Ar timestamp_offset
specifies the number of timestamp steps
.Xr pam_ocra 8
will make while verifying a response. The verify process will start at
(current_timestamp -
.Ar timestamp_offset )
and end at (current_timestamp +
.Ar timestamp_offset ) .
This parameter is optional.
.El
.It Cm sync
Synchronize the counter with two responses from the OTP device. Based on a
user selectable challenge and two subsequent responses it is possible to brute
force the counter in the OTP device.
When the counter is found, the database is updated. The counter is searched from
0 to UINT_MAX.
.Bl -tag -width ".FL f"
.It Fl f Ar credential_file
the OCRA credential file.
.It Fl c Ar challenge
Challenge entered in the OTP device.
.It Fl r Ar response
First response for the given challenge.
.It Fl v Ar second response
Second response for the given challenge.
