.Sh NAME
.Nm pam_ocra
.Nd RFC6287 OCRA: OATH Challenge-Response Algorithm PAM module
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Op Ar service-name
.Ar module-type
.Ar control-flag
.Pa pam_ocra
.Op Ar options
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
OCRA service module for PAM,
.Nm
provides functionality for only one PAM category:
authentication.
In terms of the
.Ar module-type
parameter, this is the
.Dq Li auth
feature.
It also provides null functions for the remaining module types.
.Ss OCRA Authentication Module
The OCRA authentication component
.Pq Fn pam_sm_authenticate
obtains OCRA credentials from the the per-user file
.Ar ~/.ocra .
If the
.Cm dir
parameter is set,
.Ar directory/USERNAME
will be used. It then
provides the user with an OCRA challenge and verifies the response.
.Pp
The following options may be passed to the authentication module:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm disallow"
.It Cm dir Ns = Ns Ar directory
Specifies the additional directory to search for OCRA credentials.
.It Cm nodata Ns = Ns Ar action
Determines how the module handles the situation where there is no OCRA data
file associated with the user.  Use this option when some accounts use OCRA
authentication but other accounts do not.  The
.Ar action
value must be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width ".So \  Sc (space)"
.It Sq Cm fail
In the absence of this option, or
if the
.Ar action
is set to
.Sq Cm fail
.Ns , an error message will be logged via
.Fn syslog
and PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL will be returned.  (But see
.Cm fake_prompt
.Ns , below.)
.It Sq Cm succeed
PAM_SUCCESS will be returned.
.It Sq Cm ignore
PAM_IGNORE will be returned.
.El
.Pp
Which option to use will depend on the
control flag used in PAM configuration file.
.It Cm fake_prompt Ns = Ns Ar suite_string
Use
.Ar suite_string
to generate fake challenges for users who do not have OCRA credentials.
Note that if this option is not set, no fake challenges will be generated
which can leak information to a hypothetical attacker about who uses OCRA
and who does not.
.Pp
If this option is specified, then the handling of the
.Cm nodata
option changes somewhat.  If the
.Cm nodata
option is absent, or the
.Ar action
is set to
.Sq Cm fail
.Ns , then the module will return PAM_AUTH_ERR instead of PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL.
.It Cm cmsg Ns = Ns Ar challenge_prompt Cm rmsg Ns = Ns Ar response_prompt
Change the challenge and/or the response prompts.  The
.Cm cmsg
option changes the challenge prompt, and the
.Cm rmsg
option changes the response prompt.  If the
.Cm cmsg
prompt is specified, a newline will be appended to it.  There will be no
newline appended to the
.Cm rmsg
prompt.  If spaces are included for either prompt, the prompt must be in
placed in double quotes.  For either prompt, the following formatting
directives may be used:
.Bl -tag -width ".So \  Sc (space)"
.It Sq Cm %c
Insert the challenge question.
.It Sq Cm %Nc
The challenge question with a spaces inserted after every N-th character
 (N>=1, N=<9).
.It Sq Cm %u
Insert a UTC timestamp in
.Cm ISO-8601
format. This information can be
useful when the OCRA suite string contains a time specification but the
clock on the system is unreliable.  Many SSH clients don't give visibility
to any system output prior to login, so this may be the only way to indicate
that a time discrepancy exists.  Note that the timezone abbreviation is
appended to the timestamp for readability purposes.  This timezone abbreviation
should be stripped off before parsing the timestamp.
.It Sq Cm %l
Insert a local-time timestamp in
.Cm ISO-8601
format.  (Which may still be UTC, depending on how the system is configured.)
In addition to the date and time, the timezone offset is appended to the local
timestamp.
Like its UTC counterpart, a readable timezone abbreviation is appended to the
timestamp.
.It Sq Cm %%
Insert a literal % character.
.El
.Pp
The default challenge prompt is "OCRA Challenge: %4c" and the default response
prompt is "OCRA Response: "

.Sh EXAMPLES
Note that in the following examples, the pam_ocra.so entry in the PAM
configuration file is shown on multiple lines for readability purposes.  In the
actual configuration file, the module and its options must be on one line.
.Pp
.Pp
A PAM config file with the following entries:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
auth required pam_unix.so no_warn null_ok
auth required /usr/local/lib/pam_ocra.so \e
                 nodata=succeed fake_prompt=OCRA-1:HOTP-SHA1-6:QN06-PSHA1
.Ed
.Pp
Would ask for both a normal login password and an OCRA response from all users.
If there is OCRA data associated with the user, then both authentication
methods must succeed.  A non-OCRA user only has to successfully enter the
normal login password.
.Pp
.Pp
A PAM config file with the following entries:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
auth requisite pam_unix.so no_warn null_ok
auth required /usr/local/lib/pam_ocra.so nodata=fail
.Ed
.Pp
Would ask for a normal login password from all users, but only ask for an
OCRA response if the normal login succeeded
.Em and
there was OCRA data associated with the user.  For users without OCRA
data, the login would immediately fail.
.Pp
.Pp
For both of the above examples, the prompts would appear similar to the
following:
.Bd -literal
OCRA Challenge: 123456
OCRA Response:
.Ed
.Pp
.Pp
If the options included the following prompt changes:
.Bd -literal
cmsg="%u" rmsg="OTP Response to %c: "
.Ed
.Pp
Then the prompts would look similar to:
.Bd -literal
2017-07-20T21:26:43Z UTC
OTP Response to 123456:
.Ed
.Pp
.Pp
Similarly if the options included the following prompt changes:
.Bd -literal
cmsg="%l - Challenge: %c" rmsg="Response: "
.Ed
.Pp
Then the prompts would look similar to:
.Bd -literal
2017-07-20T16:26:43-0500 CDT - Challenge: 123456
Response:
.Ed
